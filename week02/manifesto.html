  <h2>Mozilla Manifesto</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>My Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      When I read the Mozilla Manifesto, what stood out to me most was the way it treats the internet as a 
      <em>public resource</em>. That phrase really stuck with me because it reminds me that the web isn’t 
      just a collection of apps or private spaces—it’s supposed to belong to everyone. I also appreciate 
      how much they emphasize <em>privacy and security</em>; it feels like those ideas should be basic rights, 
      but in practice they’re constantly challenged. The manifesto’s focus on community-driven innovation 
      also resonated with me. I like the idea that the best parts of the internet come from people building 
      things together, not just big companies setting the rules. Overall, reading it gave me a sense of 
      responsibility to think about how I use the web and what kind of online world I want to help create.

  <h2>Tim Berners-Lee’s “Long Live the Web”</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>My Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Reading Berners-Lee’s essay really made me stop and think about how much of the web I take for granted. 
      I like that he keeps coming back to the idea of <em>universality</em>—that anyone should be able to link to anything. 
      It feels so obvious now, but without it the web would just be a patchwork of walled gardens. 
      I also connected with his point on <em>decentralization</em>; I don’t want to have to ask for permission to publish a thought or a project. 
      His reminder about <em>open standards</em> being royalty-free hit me too, because it’s easy to forget that behind the scenes, a ton of work went into making sure no single company “owns” the building blocks of the web. 
      And honestly, his defense of <em>net neutrality</em> feels more relevant than ever—if internet providers start deciding what loads fast and what doesn’t, the whole spirit of a free and equal web breaks. 
      Put together, his ideas push me to see the web less as just a convenience and more as a shared responsibility.

      Both the manifesto and Berners-Lee’s essay reminded me that the web isn’t just a tool I use every day—it’s a shared space that only stays open and free if we keep fighting for it.
