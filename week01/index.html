                This page is my reading reflection for Week 1. Below are my thoughts, questions, and conclusion. Reading this article made me realize how <mark>even the boldest ideas can eventually shape the future</mark>, 
                and why it’s important to think carefully about the technology we create today.

                <li>Prediction of technology</li>
                <li>Impact on knowledge sharing</li>
                <li>Concerns about future risks</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
                <li style = "color:rgb(195, 229, 136); font-size: 25px;">THOUGHTS🤔: Reading Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think” was really eye-opening. It’s kind of wild to think that back in 1945 he was already imagining things that sound a lot like computers, search engines, and even the internet. I was surprised at how many of his predictions actually came true, and it made me appreciate how forward-thinking he was. </li>
                <li style = "color:darkcyan; font-size: 20px; font-family: Gill, Calibri;">QUESTIONS💡: He mainly saw it as a way to boost human intelligence and make sharing knowledge easier, but he didn’t really touch on the downsides or risks. While reading, I couldn’t help but wonder what he would think about AI today—would he see it as the next step of his “memex” idea, or would he be worried about how powerful it’s become?</li>
                <li style = "color:rgb(154, 123, 86); font-size: 25px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">CONCLUSION📖: Bush’s essay reminded me that even the boldest ideas can shape the future, and it made me appreciate how important it is to think critically about the technology we’re creating today.</li>
            </ul>
